# poormans-labyrinth

Give us a playground for once we have penetrated SSH on a box.

Structure:

* models that describe fun things
* an index page designed to look like a reporting page
* lots more configuration than is needed for such simplicity

The index/fake reporting page will include a series of questions for "attackers"
to try and answer.
